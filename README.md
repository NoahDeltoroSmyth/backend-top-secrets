# Plan for Top-Secrets from scratch

## SQL SETUP

- secrets table includes

  - id : bigint generated
  - title : text Required
  - description : text Required
  - created_at : timestamp Autogenerated

- users table includes
  - id : bigint generated
  - email : text Required
  - password : text Required (hash & salt)

## Workflow Approach

1. test
2. controller
3. model
4. middleware (refactor)

## Order of tasks

1. get a user able to register using email & password
2. get a user able to sign in using email & password
3. get a user able to create secrets using POST to `/api/v1/secrets`
4. get a user able to view secrets by GET to `/api/v1/secrets`
5. get a user able to sign out

## Dependencies

- npm i jsonwebtoken cookie-parser bcryptjs

## MISC

- Don't forget YML file at the end
- Work in verticals (refer to Workflow Approach)
- PASSWORD MUST BE PRIVATE. DO NOT STORE PASSWORD AS PLAIN TEXT OR IN JWT

## Difficulties

- Baby step workflow for sign in. Once I wrote the test, it was hard to make a basic controller before writing model and service.
